## Interview Tips

When citing these statistics:

1. **Be specific about source:** "BTI Consulting found that..." or "According to the LMA/Above the Law survey..."

2. **Explain the 'so what':** Don't just cite the stat - explain why it matters for UBG
   - 86% referrals → "So marketing should focus on enabling referrers, not just creating content"
   - 70% lawyer reputation → "So attorney visibility matters more than firm brand"

3. **Connect to your approach:**
   - "This is why my 90-day plan starts with referral mapping"
   - "This is why the tools I built focus on attorney visibility, not firm-level branding"

4. **If pressed on exact methodology:** Say "This is from [source]'s research on outside counsel relationships - I can share the specific research document if helpful"
