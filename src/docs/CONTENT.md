### Research-Backed Stats

| Stat | Label | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 86% | Find Counsel Through Referrals | Peer recommendations drive most hiring decisions |
| 70% | Choose Lawyer Over Firm | Individual attorney visibility matters most |
| 275+ | Attorneys Across 9 Offices | A unified platform with untapped cross-sell potential |

### What Actually Drives Law Firm Growth

**Introduction:** Research shows clients don't choose firms based on LinkedIn followers or content volume. They choose based on who they know, who's been recommended, and who demonstrates deep understanding of their problems.

#### Referral Networks
86% of general counsel find outside counsel through peer referrals. The question isn't "how do we get more followers?" but "who's recommending our attorneys, and why?"
- Map where referrals actually come from
- Strengthen relationships with referral sources
- Make attorneys more referable through visibility

#### Attorney Visibility
70% of clients select based on the individual lawyer, not the firm brand. Marketing's job is to make individual attorneys visible and credible to the people who hire them.
- Elevate attorney thought leadership
- Build individual professional brands
- Connect attorneys to their target audiences

#### Cross-Sell Opportunity
With 275+ attorneys across 9 offices, existing client relationships represent the biggest growth opportunity. The merger created cross-sell potential that's ready to activate.
- Identify clients using only one practice area
- Facilitate warm introductions across practices
- Build internal referral culture

#### Client Experience
70% of recommendations are driven by service quality. The best marketing is delivering great service and making sure clients know they can tell others about it.
- Systematic client feedback collection
- Service quality standards
- Turn satisfied clients into advocates

### What This Demonstration Includes

I built this to show how I approach marketing challenges—research-backed strategy paired with practical tools that can actually be implemented.

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 90-Day Plan | Revenue-connected roadmap with measurable outcomes |
| AI Content Tool | Transform attorney expertise into LinkedIn content |
| Referral Intel | Track and strengthen referral relationships |
| About Kyle | Experience that maps to what UBG needs |

### Marketing That Respects Attorney Time

I know attorneys are busy. Any marketing initiative that requires significant attorney time won't get adopted. That's why my approach focuses on:

- **Low-friction participation** — 15-minute interviews that marketing turns into content
- **AI-powered efficiency** — Technology that multiplies marketing output without multiplying ask
- **Marketing does the work** — Attorneys provide expertise, we handle everything else
- **Visible ROI** — Clear connection between marketing activity and business results

### CTA Section

**Title:** Let's Talk About What UBG Needs

This demonstration shows my approach: understand the business first, then build marketing that actually connects to revenue. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how this thinking could work for UB Greensfelder.

🔑 Three Things Every Franchisor Should Review Before Year-End

As we approach Q1, I'm advising franchisors to audit three critical areas:

1️⃣ **FDD Compliance** — State registration deadlines are approaching. Is your Franchise Disclosure Document current with all material changes from 2024?

2️⃣ **Franchisee Performance Clauses** — Economic pressures have made performance benchmarks more contentious. Review your termination and renewal provisions now.

3️⃣ **Multi-Unit Development Agreements** — The shift to larger operators continues. Ensure your development schedules reflect realistic market conditions.

At UB Greensfelder, we're seeing increased M&A activity in the franchise space. If you're considering a transaction or need to update your franchise program, let's connect.

⚠️ Supply Chain Claims: What Contractors Need to Document NOW

The construction industry is still navigating material cost volatility and delivery delays. Here's what I'm telling clients to protect their interests:

📋 **Document Everything**
- Keep contemporaneous logs of delay notices
- Photograph material conditions upon delivery
- Track all change order communications in writing

💡 **Force Majeure ≠ Automatic Relief**
Many contracts require specific notice procedures. Miss those deadlines, and you may waive valuable claims.

📊 **Quantify Impact Daily**
Extended general conditions, acceleration costs, and productivity losses need real-time tracking—not reconstruction months later.

The projects I see succeed in dispute resolution are the ones with bulletproof documentation from day one.

What documentation challenges are you seeing on your projects?

#### Healthcare - LinkedIn Post

🏥 The Regulatory Landscape Shift Healthcare Providers Can't Ignore

Three regulatory developments every healthcare executive should be watching:

**1. Price Transparency Enforcement**
CMS has increased penalties and is actively auditing hospital compliance. If your machine-readable files aren't perfect, you're at risk.

**2. Physician Non-Compete Limitations**
The legal landscape around physician non-competes is evolving rapidly. Multi-state health systems need jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis.

**3. Telehealth Permanency**
Post-pandemic telehealth rules are still in flux. Credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement policies vary widely by payer.

We're helping clients build compliance programs that anticipate—not just react to—regulatory change.

What regulatory challenge is keeping you up at night?

#### Litigation - LinkedIn Post
```
⚖️ The Deposition Mistake That Costs Clients Millions

After 20+ years of complex commercial litigation, I see the same pattern destroy cases:

**Witness preparation that focuses on facts, not framing.**

Your key witnesses know the facts. The question is: Can they communicate them persuasively under pressure?

Here's what effective preparation looks like:

🎯 **Teach the themes** — Witnesses should understand how their testimony fits the case narrative
🎯 **Practice the pivots** — How to redirect from opposing counsel's traps to your key points
🎯 **Master the "I don't know"** — Sometimes the strongest answer is the honest acknowledgment of limits

The best trial lawyers treat witness prep as seriously as opening statements.

How do you prepare your key witnesses?

#### Corporate/M&A - LinkedIn Post
```
📊 The Due Diligence Item Everyone Misses (Until It's Too Late)

In the rush of M&A transaction timelines, I consistently see one area under-analyzed:

**Customer concentration risk.**

You're acquiring a business with 30% of revenue from one customer. That customer:
- Has a contract expiring in 18 months
- Is renegotiating similar contracts at 15% lower rates
- Just hired a new CPO focused on vendor consolidation

This isn't a legal risk. It's a valuation risk that legal due diligence uncovers.

The best transactions happen when legal, financial, and strategic diligence work together—not in silos.

What's the most unexpected issue you've found in due diligence?

```

### How This Would Work in Production

**1. Attorney Input**
Attorneys share recent matters, insights, or topics they want to address. Takes 5 minutes of their time.

**2. AI Generation**
Claude API creates draft content in the attorney's voice, following firm brand guidelines and platform best practices.

**3. Marketing Polish**
Marketing team reviews, refines, and schedules. Attorneys approve final version before publication.

### The Business Case
- **Scale:** Generate content for 275+ attorneys without proportional marketing staff increase
- **Consistency:** Maintain brand voice across all practice areas and offices
- **Speed:** Reduce content creation time from days to hours
- **Attorney Buy-In:** Lower barrier to participation by minimizing time commitment

## Referral Intelligence (`/referrals`)

### Header

**Badge:** Tool Demo #2

**Title:** Referral Intelligence Dashboard

**Description:** 86% of general counsel find outside counsel through peer referrals. This tool helps track, strengthen, and grow those relationships.

### Context Banner

**Title:** Why This Matters

Most law firms don't systematically track where their work comes from. They know referrals matter, but can't answer: "Who are our top 10 referral sources?" or "Which relationships are we underinvesting in?" This tool concept shows how to answer those questions.

### Tab 1: Referral Sources

#### Summary Stats
| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 35 | Total Referrals (12 mo) | |
| 5 | Active Referral Sources | |
| 7.0 | Avg Referrals/Source | |
| $2.1M | Referred Revenue | |

#### Top Referral Sources (Mock Data)
| Source | Type | Referrals | Last Referral | Connected Attorneys |
|--------|------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Thompson & Associates | Law Firm | 12 | 2024-01 | Sarah Chen, Mike Rodriguez |
| Midwest Manufacturing Alliance | Industry Group | 8 | 2024-02 | James Wilson, Lisa Park |
| Robert Hartley (Former Client) | Individual | 6 | 2023-11 | Sarah Chen |
| STL Business Journal | Media/Event | 5 | 2024-01 | Mike Rodriguez, James Wilson |
| Healthcare Compliance Forum | Industry Group | 4 | 2023-12 | Lisa Park |

### Tab 2: Cross-Sell Pipeline

#### Summary Stats
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 4 | Active Opportunities |
| 2 | High Readiness |
| $850K | Potential Revenue |

#### Cross-Sell Opportunities (Mock Data)
| Client | Current Practice | Opportunity | Primary Contact | Readiness |
|--------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Acme Manufacturing | Corporate | Labor & Employment | Sarah Chen | High |
| Regional Health System | Healthcare | Real Estate | Lisa Park | Medium |
| Midwest Distributors | Litigation | Corporate | James Wilson | High |
| Tech Startup Co | IP | Corporate | Mike Rodriguez | Low |

#### Suggested Actions
1. **Schedule intro: Sarah Chen → Labor attorney for Acme Manufacturing** — High readiness opportunity, strong existing relationship
2. **Schedule intro: James Wilson → Corporate attorney for Midwest Distributors** — High readiness, client expanding operations

### Tab 3: Attorney Network

#### Summary Stats
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 47 | Total Referrals Received |
| 28 | Referrals Sent |
| 1.7x | Receive:Send Ratio |

#### Attorney Referral Activity (Mock Data)
| Attorney | Practice | Sent | Received | Top Source |
|----------|----------|------|----------|------------|
| Sarah Chen | Corporate | 8 | 15 | Thompson & Associates |
| Mike Rodriguez | Litigation | 5 | 12 | STL Business Journal |
| James Wilson | Real Estate | 12 | 9 | Midwest Manufacturing Alliance |
| Lisa Park | Healthcare | 3 | 11 | Healthcare Compliance Forum |

#### Network Strengths
- Sarah Chen's relationship with Thompson & Associates is highly productive
- James Wilson is a strong internal referrer (12 sent to colleagues)
- Industry group memberships generating consistent referrals

#### Opportunities to Strengthen
- Lisa Park's network has high receive rate but low send rate—opportunity to reciprocate
- Media/event referrals underutilized—consider speaker program expansion
- No active referral relationships in Denver or Dallas offices

### What This Tool Demonstrates

This isn't just a mock-up—it shows the thinking behind revenue-connected marketing. Most firms track marketing activities (content published, events attended). The right question is: "What's actually generating work?"

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Track Sources | Know who refers work and strengthen those relationships |
| Find Cross-Sells | Identify clients who could use more of the firm |
| Map Networks | Understand each attorney's referral ecosystem |

## 90-Day Plan (`/roadmap`)

### Header

**Title:** 90-Day Plan for UB Greensfelder

**Description:** A realistic approach focused on what actually drives law firm growth: referrals, client relationships, and revenue-connected marketing.

### Context Banner

**Title:** The Reality This Plan Addresses

| Stat | Insight |
|------|---------|
| 86% | of law firm relationships start with peer referrals |
| 70% | of GCs recommend firms for service quality, not price |
| 70% | say individual lawyer reputation matters more than firm brand |

### Phase 1: Days 1-30 — Listen First, Win Early

**Tagline:** Build internal credibility. Understand before prescribing.

#### Stakeholder Discovery
- 1:1s with practice group leaders—learn their BD pain points, not assume them
- Review top 20 client relationships: Who's referring? Who's not? Why?
- Assess CRM and data situation—can't build referral intelligence without clean data
- Understand post-merger dynamics across 9 offices

#### Quick Wins
- One visible improvement in first 30 days—could be a refreshed pitch deck, LinkedIn push, or client event
- Audit current content: what's getting read vs. ignored? (Only 25% of GCs rate law firm content as valuable)
- Identify 3-5 attorneys ready to pilot LinkedIn activation

#### Relationship Mapping
- Where did the last 20 new clients come from? (Referral? RFP? Direct?)
- Identify top referral sources—who's sending business?
- Map cross-practice gaps: which clients use only one practice area?

#### Why This Matters
Partners are skeptical of marketing until they see results. The first 30 days are about earning trust, not launching big initiatives.

*"I won't come in with assumptions. I'll learn your attorneys, your clients, your culture first."*

### Phase 2: Days 31-60 — Build the Engine

**Tagline:** Put systems in place that will compound over time.

#### Attorney Visibility Program
- LinkedIn activation for 10-15 attorneys (66% of decision-makers value LinkedIn most)
- AI-assisted content creation—lower the barrier to participation
- Focus on individual attorney reputation, not just firm brand

#### Referral Tracking System
- Implement referral source tracking—you can't grow what you don't measure
- Identify dormant referral sources (clients who should be referring but aren't)
- Create referral cultivation playbook for partners

#### Content Quality Overhaul
- New standard: only publish what's actionable and relevant
- Kill generic client alerts—GCs ignore them
- "Forwardable updates": content GCs can send straight to their CEO

#### Client Feedback Loop
- Simple post-matter check-ins—surface problems before they cost the relationship
- Only 35% of GCs would recommend their primary firm—we need to know where we stand
- Feed insights back to practice groups

### Phase 3: Days 61-90 — Connect to Revenue

**Tagline:** Show marketing's impact on business development.

#### Cross-Sell Campaign
- Identify 5-10 clients using only one practice area
- Coordinate introductions to relevant practice groups
- Average client uses 1.3 practice areas—top firms average 2.1

#### RFP Process Upgrade
- Industry average RFP win rate is 27-30%—audit our recent wins and losses
- Create tailored pitch templates by industry/practice
- GCs hate generic pitches—show we understand their business

#### Client Service Standards
- Document "forwardable update" standards—emails a GC can send to their CEO
- Response time expectations and escalation paths
- 70% of GCs recommend based on service quality—this is the differentiator

#### Measurement & Next Phase
- Present 90-day results to leadership with clear metrics
- Propose 6-month roadmap based on what we learned
- Track: referrals generated, cross-sells initiated, client feedback scores

### Success Metrics at Day 90

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 100% | Referral Sources Mapped | Know where business comes from |
| 5+ | Cross-Sell Intros Made | Expanding existing relationships |
| 15 | Attorneys on LinkedIn | Building individual reputations |
| Live | Client Feedback System | Know where we stand |

**Note:** These are realistic 90-day outcomes, not aspirational metrics. The real transformation happens in months 4-12, built on this foundation.

### What This Plan Signals

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| I'll listen before I act | Not coming in with a playbook that ignores your reality |
| I understand partner dynamics | Quick wins build credibility before big initiatives |
| I'm focused on revenue | Referrals, cross-sells, win rates—not vanity metrics |
| I know what 90 days can accomplish | Not overpromising transformation |

**Footer:** This roadmap adapts based on what we learn in the discovery phase. It's a framework grounded in how law firms actually grow.
